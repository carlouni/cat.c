This is a simplified version of the cat program. It should be able to compile on Linux Debian and derivatives.
It may also compile on other systems as I tried to comply with the C standards.

Used as reference and for inspiration the links below and other sources from the GNU project. However, I believe
my version is easier to understand.

Obs. This program has been done as part of an assignment at Griffith University - Australia thus be aware not to use
the code as part of your assignment but as a usefull reference.

### Building executables on Linux:

    1.- Make sure the system has the 'gcc compiler' and 'make'.
    
    2.- From the Linux terminal execute the following commands:
        $ cd assignment1
        $ make

### Running the programs:
    cat:
    ---
    1.- $ ./cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...
    2.- All cat options were implemented.

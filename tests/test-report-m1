### Test report milestone 1 (cat)
    Test included various data inputs sent from the command line and its execution was
    followed using the GNU gdb tool (Break points: lines 10, 15, 16, 21 ).

    Introducing random data as shown below the result was successful:
    
    I: ^H
    O: ^H
    I: ^G
    O: ^G
    I: sdaf
    O: sdaf
    I: 4543v
    O: 4543v
    I: ,m.nm,l
    O: ,m.nm,l
    I: /;'jjkj
    O: /;'jjkj
    I: teye
    O: teye
    I: !@#~$%^&*
    O: !@#~$%^&*
    I: +_":"L:"L?>"D\
    O: +_":"L:"L?>"D\
    I: \n
    O: \n
    I: 
    O: 
    I: \
    I: \

    Testing key combinations:
    
    Ctrl + C: Sends an interrupt signal (The program stops execution).
    ENTER   : Application prints data introduced from the prompt.    
    Ctrl + D: Sends an EOF (If some characters where introduced before "Ctrl + D",
              the application behaves as if an ENTER had been introduced but without
              a break line at the end.)
    Other   : If the key combination results in a standard character the program 
              behaves as expected. In some cases, strange characters gave empty
              results but without breaking the application.

### Test report milestone 3 (cat)
    
    Comparing outputs from own version of cat and the system's cat
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    For testing purposes, the combination of the additional options (-b -s -v -t -e)
    were added to the script "tests/tester.sh"

    The test compared the results of the system's cat and the own cat as suggested
    below.
    
    cat some_options > system_output
    ./cat some_options > my_output
    diff -u system_output my_output

    * To run the test from the command line, execute the following:
    
    $ bash tests/tester.sh
    
    The tester helped to identify two issues regarding non-printing ascii characters
    and the TAB key. This issues were successfully fixed.

    Testing cat with multiple files
    -------------------------------
    
    Cat performs the concatenation of the files as expected  for all option combinations.

### Test report milestone 2 (cat)
    
    Comparing outputs from own version of cat and the system's cat
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    For testing purposes, a bash script ('tests/tester.sh') was created. This evaluates
    various combinations of the implemented options and compares the outputs with the
    outputs generated by the system's cat as suggested in the milestone 2 lab.

    cat some_options > system_output
    ./cat some_options > my_output
    diff -u system_output my_output

    
    The test involved random text files located in the directory 'tests/testing-files/'.
    The result was successful for all the option combinations.

    To run the test from the command line, execute the following:
    
    $ bash tests/tester.sh
    
    See results below

    Testing error handling
    ----------------------

    A common error handling case is when a non-existent file is entered as parameter.
    If this is the case, the application will display an error message.
    
    Example:
    $ ./cat non-existent-file.txt
    cat: non-existent-file.txt: No such file or directory

    Testing cat with data taken from the stdin
    ------------------------------------------
    
    $ ./cat

    sadas
    sadas
    fwsdsf
    fwsdsf
    ou[645
    ou[645
    %JDS*R))|}
    %JDS*R))|}
    
    When using option -n, the line number increments for each input. This behaviour
    is also presented in the system's cat.

    $ ./cat -n
    gsdfgsdfg
         1	gsdfgsdfg
    fdsfs45
         2	fdsfs45

### Test report milestone 2 (cat)
    
    Comparing outputs from own version of cat and the system's cat
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    For testing purposes, a bash script ('tests/tester.sh') was created. This evaluates
    various combinations of the implemented options and compares the outputs with the
    outputs generated by the system's cat as suggested in the milestone 2 lab.

    cat some_options > system_output
    ./cat some_options > my_output
    diff -u system_output my_output

    The test involved random text files located in the directory 'tests/testing-files/'.
    The result was successful for all the option combinations.

    To run the test from the command line, execute the following:
    
    $ bash tests/tester.sh
    
    See results below.

    Testing cat with multiple files
    -------------------------------
    
    Cat concatenates the files entered as parameters. If the -n option is provided,
    the line number will start with 1 for each file.

    The Linux kernel is a Unix-like computer operating system kernel.
    The Linux kernel is a widely used operating system kernel world-wide;
    the Linux operating system is based on it and deployed on both
    traditional computer systems, usually in the form of Linux distributions
    , and on embedded devices such as routers. The Android operating system 
    for tablet computers and smartphones is also based atop the Linux kernel.

    Testing error handling
    ----------------------

    A common error handling case is when a non-existent file is entered as parameter.
    If this is the case, the application will display an error message.
    
    Example:
    $ ./cat non-existent-file.txt
    cat: non-existent-file.txt: No such file or directory

    Testing cat with data taken from the stdin
    ------------------------------------------
    
    $ ./cat

    %JDS*R))|}
    %JDS*R))|}
    
    When using option -n, the line number increments for each input. This behaviour
    is also presented in the system's cat.

    $ ./cat -n
